### Praxyk.com

This is a fork of the original website, meant for testing out new ideas and frameworks.

#### Build and Config
The website is run using flask for request handling, jinja2 for templating, and javascript for other stuff. We make use of the `virtualenv` tool to construct the entire environment for the website locally.

To install the requirements on a new Ubuntu instance, use the commands below.
```sh
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv
```
